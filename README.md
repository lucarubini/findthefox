This repo is inspired by xxxxxxx. 

Here's a clearer version of your instructions:

**Objective:** Simulate the success rate with multiple runs.

**Rules:**
1. You have a 4x4 grid.
2. On the table, there are characters 'f', 'o', and 'x', flipped face-down (you don't know which is which in advance).
3. Fill the grid by randomly choosing a character from the table.
4. If you form the word "fox" horizontally, vertically, diagonally (forwards or backwards), you lose.
5. The grid can be initialized randomly or with specific settings.

The script simulates multiple games where:
- Characters ('f', 'o', 'x') are randomly sampled.
- Cells in the grid are selected randomly.

Check the `RUN_GAMES.txt` file for instructions on how to run the game.

I hope that makes it clearer! Let me know if you need any more help.
